YASARA Version 21.12.19.L.64 detected error 194: The central atom of an
improper dihedral must always have 3 bonds in the force fields, but this is
not the case for atom 20. Either correct the residue if there is an error
(try Edit > Clean > All), or rename it to indicate that the standard force
field parameters cannot be used.
